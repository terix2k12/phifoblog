# Phifo Blog

This is a lightweight open-source PHP blog.

It is a small hobby project to power my blog on https://www.philippfonteyn.de 

## Why a new PHP blog?

There are already very powerful PHP blogs out there. I created this one because I do programming for fun and to learn a little bit about PHP, CSS and web-projects in general.

## Install

Fully automated installation not yet supported. Currently three steps are necessary:
- copy the whole project onto your webspace
- create a SQL database with the tables LOGINREGISTER and ARTICLES 
- Edit the dbcredentials.php
